1. Availability for meeting expectations
Friday through Monday im avaliable after 1 pm usually. Tuesday-Thursday I have classes all day so I wouldn't be
able to meet till after 6:30 pm, which is do-able but obviously a bit later in the night

2. Response time to communication expectations
I should be able to respond within an hour of anyone talking to me, but it'll likely be sooner

3. Definition of done: when is a task complete? (hint: "I'm done with that but I didn't check it in to github" is not done.)
A task is done when it's checked into github, and at least two other people have approved it

4. Scrum meeting format/frequency and distribution of documentation tasks (meeting minutes, updating task board)
I think we should meet as much as possible and probably about 30 minutes to an hour each time

5. Procedure for adopting policies (e.g. code style, code check-in steps, documentation updates)
 a. if you adopt such a policy during the initial meeting, put it here
 probably just a group vote for majority rules. Have documentation for meeting and whatever code you write
 
6. Procedure for handling a member who is not meeting expectations
 a. must include at least 3 actions before involving the instructor
 1. Talk to them about it
 2. Meet with group to split work if needed
 3. Contact TA and see if they can say anything to them
 4. Ask instructor to contact them/talk to them
 
7 Signatures: each member must sign their name by typing their name at the bottom of the document.
